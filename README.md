# TwitterScraperSelenium
The package provides an opportunity to scrape tweets by a particular query, date and parameters. Scraping is powered by Selenium library, which implements auto scrolling and end of the page detection.
# Usage example
See the sample written in twitterScraper.py
# Caution
Special characters (mostly everything but for the letters and numbers) should be reformated into HTML URL format (e.g. spaces into %20).
Since and until dates strings should have a format of Y-m-d (e.g. 2016-09-25).
